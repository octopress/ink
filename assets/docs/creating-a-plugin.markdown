*This guide assumes you have already installed Git, and have Ruby 1.9.3 or greater.*

Octopress Ink plugins are distributed as ruby gems so you'll need to create an account at [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/sign_up) if you haven't yet. Also, be sure to install the [Bundler](http://bundler.io) gem.

## Creating a plugin

Creating an Octopress Ink plugin is very simple. Here's the standard template.

{% render ./_plugin-template.markdown %}

The configuration options are as follows.

{% render ./_configuration.markdown %}

Note: For themes, the slug will be set to `theme`. This makes it easy for users to work with any theme with a consistent slug name.

Next you simply need an `assets` directory at the root of your gem with subdirectories for each asset type you plan to use in your plugin.

If you have a gem-based plugin which you'd like to convert into an Octopress Ink plugin, this should make it easy for you.

```sh
$ octopress ink init your_gem
```

This will add the asset directories, create a demo site, and print out a plugin template with instructions for how to add it to your gem.

### Create a plugin from scratch

To create a new plugin named "Some Plugin" run:

```sh
$ octopress ink new some_plugin
```

This does the following.

- Creates a new gem using Bundler's gem scaffolding.
- It adds `octopress` and `octopress-ink` as dependencies in the gemspec.
- An Octopress Ink plugin template is added to `lib/some_plugin.rb`.
- `assets/` contains empty asset directories.
- `demo/` contains a blank Jekyll site with your plugin already integrated for easy testing.

Here's what the new `some_plugin` directory looks like.

```
assets/
  docs/
  files/
  fonts/
  images/
  includes/
  javascripts/
  layouts/
  pages/
  stylesheets/
lib/
  some_plugin/
    version.rb
  some_plugin.rb
demo/
  _layouts/
  _posts/
  Gemfile
  index.html
some_plugin.gemspec
Gemfile
LICENSE.txt
Rakefile
README.md
```

In `lib/some_plugin.rb` you'll find an Octopress Ink plugin created specifically for your gem.

```ruby
require 'lib/version'
require 'octopress-ink'

Octopress::Ink.add_plugin({
  name:          "Some Plugin"
  slug:          "some_plugin",
  assets_path:   File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "../assets")),
  type:          "some_plugin",
  version:       SomePlugin::Version,
  description:   "",
  website:       ""
})
```

Change whatever you want and you are ready to start building your plugin.

### Building on an existing plugin

If you're going to convert an existing gem-based Jekyll plugin to use Octopress Ink, from your gem directory run:

```sh
$ octopress ink init .
```

This will add the assets directories and the demo site to your
plugin. To finish setting up your plugin, you'll need to add the plugin template to your gem.

## Plugin assets

Octopress Ink plugins make it super easy to integrate assets with any Jekyll site. Your plugin should have an `assets` directory,
typically in the root directory of your gem. Inside `assets` there will be folders for each asset type your plugin uses plan to use.

Note: Assets are copied at build time and assets will not overwrite an existing file.

| Asset directory |  Description                                    |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| layouts         | Users can add layouts by setting `layout: plugin_slug:some_layout` in a page's YAML front-matter.     |
| includes        | Includes are available to users by `{% raw %}{% include plugin_slug:some_file.html %}{% endraw %}`.   |
| pages           | `pages/feed.xml` is processed and copied to `_site/feed.xml` at build time. Setting `permalink: feed/` renders to `_site/feed/index.xml`. |
| files           | `files/favicon.ico` is copied to `_site/favicon.ico`.                                                   |
| fonts           | `wingdings.ttf` is copied to `_site/fonts/plugin_slug/wingdings.ttf`.                                 |
| images          | `cat.gif` is copied to `_site/images/plugin_slug/cat.gif`.                                            |
| javascripts     | `boom.js` is combined with all plugin javascripts into a single fingerprinted file.                     |
| stylesheets     | `theme.scss` and `print.css` are combined with all plugin stylesheets into a single fingerprinted file. |
| docs            | Add documentation files for your plugin here. Users will be able to read it by running `octopress docs`. [read more]({% doc_url plugin-documentation %}) |


### Layouts

Layouts will probably mostly be useful if you're developing a theme. For a typical theme you'll probably have three layouts:

```
assets/
  layouts/
    default.html
    page.html
    post.html
```

Here's a example of a simple `default.html` layout.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{ page.title }} - {{ site.title }}</title>
    {% octopress_css %}
  </head>
  <body>
    {{ content }}
    {% octopress_js %}
  </body>
</html>
```

You'll notice the `{% octopress_css %}` and `{% octopress_js %}` tags. These are special tags that come with Octopress Ink and output the `<link>` and `<script>` tags from the Octopress Ink asset pipeline.

A `page.html` or `post.html` might look like this:

```
---
layout: theme:default
---
<article>
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
{{ content }}
</article>
```

You'll notice that the default layout is included with `layout: theme:default`. Of course, if your plugin's slug was `baconnaise` you'd use `layout: baconnaise:default`.

Users can override the theme's default layout by adding a file to `_plugins/theme/layouts/default.html`. Now the theme's page and post layouts will 
load the user's default layout instead of loading it from the theme's assets. If your plugin's slug was `baconnaise` the user could override the layout by placing a
file at `_plugins/baconnaise/layouts/default.html`.

### Includes

Includes are how you store a partial of code to be reused in several locations. For example, you might want to share site navigation between several layouts.

```
assets/
  includes/
    navigation.html
```

To include this partial, use an include tag, but add the plugin slug before the filename like this `{% include plugin_slug:navigation %}`.
